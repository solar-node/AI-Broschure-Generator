      "We aim to build frontier AI systems that are reliable, interpretable, and steerable. We conduct frontier research, develop and apply a variety of safety techniques, and deploy the resulting systems via a set of partnerships and products.\n",
      "Safety Is a Science\n",
      "We treat AI safety as a systematic science, conducting research, applying it to our products, feeding those insights back into our research, and regularly sharing what we learn with the world along the way.\n",
      "Interdisciplinary\n",
      "Anthropic is a collaborative team of researchers, engineers, policy experts, business leaders and operators, who bring our experience from many different domains to our work.\n",
      "AI Companies are One Piece of a Big Puzzle\n",
      "AI has the potential to fundamentally change how the world works. We view ourselves as just one piece of this evolving puzzle. We collaborate with civil society, government, academia, nonprofits and industry to promote safety industry-wide.\n",
      "The Team\n",
      "We’re a team of researchers, engineers, policy experts and operational leaders, with experience spanning a variety of disciplines, all working together to build reliable and understandable AI systems.\n",
      "Research\n",
      "We conduct frontier AI research across a variety of modalities, and explore novel and emerging safety research areas from interpretability to RL from human feedback to policy and societal impacts analysis.\n",
      "Policy\n",
      "We think about the impacts of our work and strive to communicate what we’re seeing at the frontier to policymakers and civil society in the US and abroad to help promote safe and reliable AI.\n",
      "Product\n",
      "We translate our research into tangible, practical tools like Claude that benefit businesses, nonprofits and civil society groups and their clients and people around the globe.\n",
      "Operations\n",
      "Our people, finance, legal, and recruiting teams are the human engines that make Anthropic go. We’ve had previous careers at NASA, startups, and the armed forces and our diverse experiences help make Anthropic a great place to work (and we love plants!).\n",
      "What we value and how we act\n",
      "Every day, we make critical decisions that inform our ability to achieve our mission. Shaping the future of AI and, in turn, the future of our world is a responsibility and a privilege. Our values guide how we work together, the decisions we make, and ultimately how we show up for each other and work toward our mission.\n",
      "01\n",
      "Act for the global good.\n",
      "We strive to make decisions that maximize positive outcomes for humanity in the long run. This means we’re willing to be very bold in the actions we take to ensure our technology is a robustly positive force for good. We take seriously the task of safely guiding the world through a technological revolution that has the potential to change the course of human history, and are committed to helping make this transition go well.\n",
      "02\n",
      "Hold light and shade.\n",
      "AI has the potential to pose unprecedented risks to humanity if things go badly. It also has the potential to create unprecedented benefits for humanity if things go well. We need shade to understand and protect against the potential for bad outcomes. We need light to realize the good outcomes.\n",
      "03\n",
      "Be good to our users.\n",
      "At Anthropic, we define “users” broadly. Users are our customers, policy-makers, Ants, and anyone impacted by the technology we build or the actions we take. We cultivate generosity and kindness in all our interactions—with each other, with our users, and with the world at large. Going above and beyond for each other, our customers, and all of the people affected by our technology is meeting expectations.\n",
      "04\n",
      "Ignite a race to the top on safety.\n",
      "As a safety-first company, we believe that building reliable, trustworthy, and secure systems is our collective responsibility - and the market agrees. We work to inspire a ‘race to the top’ dynamic where AI developers must compete to develop the most safe and secure AI systems. We want to constantly set the industry bar for AI safety and security and drive others to do the same.\n",
      "05\n",
      "Do the simple thing that works.\n",
      "We take an empirical approach to problems and care about the size of our impact and not the sophistication of our methods. This doesn’t mean we throw together haphazard solutions. It means we try to identify the simplest solution and iterate from there. We don’t invent a spaceship if all we need is a bicycle.\n",
      "06\n",
      "Be helpful, honest, and harmless.\n",
      "Anthropic is a high-trust, low-ego organization. We communicate kindly and directly, assuming good intentions even in disagreement. We are thoughtful about our actions, avoiding harm and repairing relationships when needed. Everyone contributes, regardless of role. If something urgently needs to be done, the right person to do it is probably you!\n",
      "07\n",
      "Put the mission first.\n",
      "At the end of the day, the mission is what we’re all here for. It gives us a shared purpose and allows us to act swiftly together, rather than being pulled in multiple directions by competing goals. It engenders trust and collaboration and is the final arbiter in our decisions. When it comes to our mission, none of us are bystanders. We each take personal ownership over making our mission successful.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Anthropic is a Public Benefit Corporation, whose purpose is the responsible development and maintenance of advanced AI for the long-term benefit of humanity. Our Board of Directors is elected by stockholders and our Long-Term Benefit Trust, as explained\n",

      "Every day, we make critical decisions that inform our ability to achieve our mission. Shaping the future of AI and, in turn, the future of our world is a responsibility and a privilege. Our values guide how we work together, the decisions we make, and ultimately how we show up for each other and work toward our mission.\n",
      "01\n",
      "Act for the global good.\n",
      "We strive to make decisions that maximize positive outcomes for humanity in the long run. This means we’re willing to be very bold in the actions we take to ensure our technology is a robustly positive force for good. We take seriously the task of safely guiding the world through a technological revolution that has the potential to change the course of human history, and are committed to helping make this transition go well.\n",
      "02\n",
      "Hold light and shade.\n",
      "AI has the potential to pose unprecedented risks to humanity if things go badly. It also has the potential to create unprecedented benefits for humanity if things go well. We need shade to understand and protect against the potential for bad outcomes. We need light to realize the good outcomes.\n",
      "03\n",
      "Be good to our users.\n",
      "At Anthropic, we define “users” broadly. Users are our customers, policy-makers, Ants, and anyone impacted by the technology we build or the actions we take. We cultivate generosity and kindness in all our interactions—with each other, with our users, and with the world at large. Going above and beyond for each other, our customers, and all of the people affected by our technology is meeting expectations.\n",
      "04\n",
      "Ignite a race to the top on safety.\n",
      "As a safety-first company, we believe that building reliable, trustworthy, and secure systems is our collective responsibility—and the market agrees. We work to inspire a ‘race to the top’ dynamic where AI developers must compete to develop the most safe and secure AI systems. We want to constantly set the industry bar for AI safety and security and drive others to do the same.\n",
      "05\n",
      "Do the simple thing that works.\n",
      "We take an empirical approach to problems and care about the size of our impact and not the sophistication of our methods. This doesn’t mean we throw together haphazard solutions. It means we try to identify the simplest solution and iterate from there. We don’t invent a spaceship if all we need is a bicycle.\n",
      "06\n",
      "Be helpful, honest, and harmless.\n",
      "Anthropic is a high-trust, low-ego organization. We communicate kindly and directly, assuming good intentions even in disagreement. We are thoughtful about our actions, avoiding harm and repairing relationships when needed. Everyone contributes, regardless of role. If something urgently needs to be done, the right person to do it is probably you!\n",
      "07\n",
      "Put the mission first.\n",
      "At the end of the day, the mission is what we’re all here for. It gives us a shared purpose and allows us to act swiftly together, rather than being pulled in multiple directions by competing goals. It engenders trust and collaboration and is the final arbiter in our decisions. When it comes to our mission, none of us are bystanders. We each take personal ownership over making our mission successful.\n",
      "Technical Interviews\n",
      "The novel challenges we think about at Anthropic demand diverse expertise and perspectives. Our interview process is designed to identify thoughtful candidates who bring unique strengths to our multidisciplinary team. If you think this may describe you, we’d love to hear from you regardless of your background or experience.\n",
      "One of the most common questions we get is about whether it is worth applying to work at Anthropic if you have not worked on modern machine learning systems in the past. Yes! For some roles, ML experience is expected, but many technical staff have arrived at Anthropic with no machine learning experience. If you aren’t sure about the ML experience needed for your role, ask your recruiter.\n",
      "We use shared environments like Colab and Replit for our programming-focused interviews. We’ll be very interested in how you think through each problem and analyze the tradeoffs between possible approaches, and we’ll also expect you to write, run, and debug your solutions. You’ll be allowed to look things up in documentation or on the web, just like you usually can (which is why we’ll ask you to share your screen throughout each interview); but it’s still important to be familiar with basic syntax, standard libraries, and common idioms in the language you’re interviewing in, so that looking things up doesn’t consume too much time. Your interview process will also include non-technical questions about your experience and what motivates you, and, of course, you’ll have time to ask us about Anthropic! We can’t wait to meet you.\n",
      "Other Things\n",
      "Engineers here do lots of research, and researchers do lots of engineering\n",
      "While there’s historically been a division between engineering and research in machine learning, we think that boundary has dissolved with the advent of large models. The distribution of candidates we interview is strongly bimodal in both engineering and research experience however, and we have necessarily tailored our interview structure to that.\n",
      "If you’ve an engineering background, please apply as an engineer. You’ll perform much better in the interviews, and if you join you’ll have as much input to Anthropic’s direction and interests as anyone else.\n",
      "As evidence towards this: all of our papers have engineers as authors, and often as first author. Research and engineering hires all share a single title — ‘Member of Technical Staff’.\n",
      "We value direct evidence of ability\n",
      "If you’ve done interesting independent research, written an insightful blog post, or made substantial contributions to open-source software, put that at the top of your resume!\n",
      "Feedback\n",
      "We do not provide feedback on resumes or interviews.\n",
      "Visas\n",
      "Anthropic sponsors visas! We aren’t able to sponsor them for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.\n",
      "Green cards\n",
      "Once you’re eligible, we’re also keen to sponsor green cards!\n",
      "Educational backgrounds and experience vary across our team and across our roles\n",
      "We do not require\n",
      "PhDs or previous ML experience\n",
      "— About half of Anthropic technical staff have a PhD of some sort; about half had prior experience in ML. We have several brilliant colleagues who never went to college.\n",
      "Remote interviewing\n",
      "All our interviews are conducted over Google Meet. We prefer PST office hours, but we can be flexible if that’s difficult for you.\n",
      "Re-applying\n",
      "Similarly, if interviews don’t work out this time, you’re welcome to re-apply after 12 months, and earlier if something materially changes about your experience or skills.\n",
      "Remote work\n",
      "Anthropic staff all come to the office regularly. Most staff live in the Bay Area, though a few live further away and come in for one week a month. We also understand that moving can take time, so as a transitional phase some folks start while fully remote.\n",
      "Offer timing\n",
      "If we make an offer, we’re happy to give you time to think about it and finish up any other interview processes you’re going through.\n",

      "Adaptive business model framework for shifting consumer behavior patterns post-2024\n",
      "Executive summary\n",
      "The business landscape in 2025 is characterized by permanent disruption, where traditional consumer behavior models no longer apply. What once seemed like short-term adaptations born of the COVID-19 pandemic have solidified into lasting behavioral change. Organizations must develop adaptive business models that can respond to five key behavioral forces: increased digital-first behaviors, declining trust in digital channels, Gen Z's growing economic influence, local preference trends, and new value-seeking patterns.\n",
      "This framework provides a systematic approach for businesses to transform their operations, embrace continuous adaptation, and thrive in an environment where consumer sentiment is no longer neatly aligned with consumer spending. Success requires moving from reactive adjustments to proactive transformation through four strategic imperatives: deep consumer understanding, advanced revenue growth management, dynamic portfolio optimization, and technology capability rewiring.\n",
      "Key consumer behavior shifts driving business model adaptation\n",
      "Digital-first convenience expectations\n",
      "The behaviors that consumers adopted for coping with life under COVID-19 lockdown—namely, a reliance on digital connectivity and at-home activities—are now permanent parts of their daily lives. This shift has created several critical implications:\n",
      "Time allocation changes\n",
      ": US consumers in 2025 report that they have over three hours more of free time a week, on average, than those in 2019 reported. But they allocate nearly 90 percent of that time to solo activities. The biggest increases are in hobbies, shopping, fitness, and social media engagement.\n",
      "Delivery expectations\n",
      ": Food delivery's share of global food service spending rose from 9 percent in 2019 to 21 percent in 2024. Consumers now expect seamless delivery across categories, with over one-third of consumers across all four regions identifying Amazon or Taobao as their go-to shopping destination for all their needs.\n",
      "Convenience premium\n",
      ": Over 80% of consumers look up brands on platforms like Instagram and TikTok before buying. Almost 70% have made purchases directly through social channels, and nearly 30% buy on the same day they discover something new.\n",
      "Trust paradox in digital channels\n",
      "A fundamental contradiction exists in consumer digital behavior. Consumers tell us that social media is their least trusted source when making buying decisions, yet it's where they interact with family and friends, who serve as their most trusted sources. This creates complex dynamics:\n",
      "Influence vs trust\n",
      ": While social media has low trust ratings, we see an increase in social media use for product research (32 percent, on average, compared with 27 percent in 2023). In emerging markets, approximately half of consumers research products on social media before purchasing.\n",
      "Cross-generational adoption\n",
      ": Digital engagement is no longer age-restricted. 33 percent of Gen Xers surveyed across Europe and the United States state that they're on TikTok, while 35 percent of baby boomers in those regions report that they're on Instagram.\n",
      "Gen Z economic emergence\n",
      "Gen Zers (born between 1996 and 2010) are projected to make up not only the largest generation but also the wealthiest in history. Their economic impact is substantial:\n",
      "Income growth\n",
      ": The average 25-year-old Gen Z consumer in the United States has a household income of $40,000, 50 percent higher than the average baby boomer's at the same age.\n",
      "Spending acceleration\n",
      ": Gen Z spending, which is growing twice as fast as previous generations' spending did at the same age, is on pace to eclipse baby boomers' spending globally by 2029. By 2035, Gen Zers will add an additional $8.9 trillion to the global economy.\n",
      "Value priorities\n",
      ": Gen Zers across markets are less likely than members of older generations to define themselves based on life stage milestones, such as getting married and having children. They're much more likely, however, to define themselves based on achievements related to financial security.\n",
      "Financial behavior\n",
      ": Despite financial concerns, more than one-quarter of surveyed Gen Z respondents report using buy-now-pay-later services to make a purchase, and 34 percent of surveyed Gen Zers report a willingness to buy on credit, which is about 13 percentage points higher than other generations.\n",
      "Local preference movement\n",
      "Over the past five years, we have seen disruptor consumer brands encroach on global, multinational brands. That trend has evolved in 2025: consumers are signaling the importance of buying local from their own markets.\n",
      "Local preference statistics\n",
      ": Globally, 47 percent of consumers identify locally owned companies as important to their purchase decision. The primary motivation is supporting domestic businesses (36% of consumers), followed by better needs alignment (20%).\n",
      "Regional variations\n",
      ": This trend is particularly strong in certain markets. In China, six of the top ten beauty brands with the most market share growth since 2020 are Chinese (up from only two from 2015 to 2020). In Japan, nine of the top ten snack brands are Japanese.\n",
      "Value redefinition patterns\n",
      "Consumer value-seeking behavior has become increasingly sophisticated and cross-category. Rising prices continue to be the number-one cause for concern among consumers across all 18 of the markets in our survey.\n",
      "Trading down complexity\n",
      ": Globally, 79 percent of surveyed consumers are trading down but not necessarily by purchasing fewer items or seeking discounts at lower-priced retailers. Instead, more than half of surveyed consumers across markets say that they look for deals on every purchase.\n",
      "Cross-category optimization\n",
      ": Cross-category trade-downs—trading down in one category to afford something in another—are becoming more prevalent. In the first half of 2025, more than one-third of consumers surveyed state that they have traded down in one category while planning to splurge in another.\n",
      "Splurging persistence\n",
      ": Even among consumers who state that they're concerned about rising prices, over one-third still have plans to splurge, indicating selective value optimization rather than across-the-board reduction.\n",
      "Adaptive business model framework components\n",
      "Framework overview\n",
      "The adaptive business model framework consists of four interconnected layers that enable organizations to respond dynamically to shifting consumer behaviors:\n",
      "Sensing layer\n",
      ": Continuous market intelligence and consumer insight generation\n",
      "Strategy layer\n",

      ": Feedback loops and continuous optimization\n",
      "This framework recognizes that companies must be really good at learning how to do new things. Those that thrive are quick to read and act on weak signals of change.\n",
      "Layer 1: Sensing layer - Consumer intelligence systems\n",
      "Real-time consumer monitoring\n",
      "Organizations must build comprehensive consumer intelligence capabilities that go beyond traditional market research. This includes:\n",

      "Layer 2: Strategy layer - Dynamic strategic planning\n",
      "Adaptive portfolio management\n",
      "Consumer players should strive to generate 20 to 30 percent new revenue from their portfolio every ten years. This requires:\n",
      "Continuous portfolio evaluation\n",
      ": Regular assessment of brand performance across markets with local preference considerations. Organizations should evaluate which brands can successfully operate beyond core markets and which should be localized or divested.\n",
      "Strategic M&A approach\n",
      ": Those that leverage M&A&D for growth generate 2.5 percentage points more TSR than those with organic growth alone do. Focus areas include:\n",

      "Revenue growth management (RGM) optimization\n",
      "Offering the right product at the right price at the right time has become more important and harder to do than ever. Advanced RGM requires:\n",

      "AI and automation integration\n",
      ": Implementation of agentic AI for consumer insights, demand management, and channel optimization. Among the 140 agentic AI and gen AI use cases that consumer players should prioritize, shaping consumer insights and demand and managing customers and channels represent the greatest value.\n",
      "Omnichannel infrastructure\n",
      ": Seamless integration across digital and physical touchpoints to meet convenience expectations.\n",
      "Supply chain agility\n",
      ": Flexible supply chain configuration to support local preferences and rapid portfolio changes.\n",

      "Conclusion\n",
      "The post-2024 consumer landscape represents a fundamental shift that requires businesses to move beyond traditional reactive adjustments toward proactive adaptive transformation. A new baseline has emerged for consumer decision-making. Despite a high level of uncertainty—not only in consumer sentiment, but also in geopolitical and economic outlook—there are many areas in which brands can find growth.\n",
      "Success in this environment requires organizations to embrace four strategic imperatives: building deep consumer understanding capabilities, implementing advanced revenue growth management, continuously optimizing portfolio composition, and rewiring technology capabilities for adaptive operations. Organizations that implement this framework systematically will be positioned to thrive in an environment where outcompeting in the coming years means anticipating the needs of an often-unpredictable consumer.\n",
      "The adaptive business model framework provides a systematic approach for this transformation, emphasizing continuous learning, rapid experimentation, and consumer-centric decision making. Organizations that successfully implement this framework will not only survive the current disruption but establish sustainable competitive advantages in the evolving consumer economy.\n",
      "By recognizing that brands that can swiftly adapt to the new realities will be well positioned to grow, regardless of the uncertainty ahead, forward-thinking organizations can transform disruption from threat to opportunity, building resilient business models that thrive on change rather than merely enduring it.\n",
      "—\n",
      "This framework synthesizes insights from extensive consumer behavior research across 18 global markets representing 75% of global GDP, incorporating strategic frameworks from leading consulting organizations and academic research on adaptive business systems.\n",

Retail and Sports sectors also delivered 100% success rates, with scalability and real-time performance capabilities driving wins. Energy and Automotive industries maintained perfect records through industry-specific compliance expertise and sustainability-focused solutions.\n",
      "Struggling Industries\n",
      "present significant challenges requiring strategic intervention. Manufacturing deals failed due to cost sensitivity and ERP integration complexities. Education sector losses stemmed from budget constraints and seasonal timing misalignment. Consulting industry struggles centered on ROI timeline concerns and extensive customization requirements. Food & Beverage deals were lost primarily due to industry-specific compliance gaps. Government sector challenges included complex procurement processes and vendor pre-approval requirements.\n",
      "Deal Size Impact\n",
      "Enterprise deals over $300K delivered a 50% win rate with 5 wins out of 10 completed opportunities, while mid-market deals under $300K achieved a perfect 100% win rate though represented only 1 completed deal. The average won deal value reached $328K compared to $288K for lost deals, indicating that higher-value opportunities are actually slightly more likely to close successfully despite their complexity.\n",

      "appeared in 4 deals with only 1 win achieved against them (25% win rate). Their primary strengths include lower cost positioning and faster implementation timelines that appeal to budget-conscious and time-sensitive prospects.\n",

      "Competitor C\n",
